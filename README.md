# Etch-a-Sketch
 A web-browser implementation of a drawing application similar to an Etch-a-Sketch. This was done as part of my course on The Odin Project

 ### Things I learned in the making of this application include:

 * Manipulating HTML DOM elements with javascript 
 * Use of HTML radio input buttons and have them maintain the back-end variables across refreshes
 * Using CSS Grid Layout with CSS variables to dynamically generate a grid of boxes
 * Attaching listeners onto \<div\> elements to listen for events (click, onmousedown, onmouseenter, onmouseexit)
